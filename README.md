# EasyConnect

We are developing a web application named 'EasyConnect' which will act as a bridge between recruiters and job seekers.
The platform will allow recruiters to post different jobs, and shortlist candidates based on various criterias. On the other hand, the job seekers will be able to view different jobs based on their search, apply to the jobs they find relevant, and they will also be able to learn new skills.
