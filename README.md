# EasyConnect

We are devising a web application designated as 'EasyConnect' which will act as a bridge between recruiters and job seekers. The podium will permit recruiters to post diverse jobs and shortlist contenders based on diverse benchmarks. On the other hand, the job seekers will be able to view different jobs based on their search, apply to the jobs they find appropriate, and they will also be able to learn new skills.
